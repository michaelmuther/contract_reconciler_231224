1 set up fake data - DONE
  -contracts - DONE
  -excel file list - DONE
2 Define requirements - DONE
3 Code the script
  - dictionary of company number as key and Company object as value
  - Input from excel file - data structure: Company class

  string company_name
  int company_number (redundant in the object as this will be the key?)
  string contact_email_address
  bool requires_ESA
  bool requires_SEA
  bool ESA_hard_copy_received
  bool SEA_hard_copy_received
  bool ESA_digital_copy_received
  bool SEA_digital_copy_received

  iterate over contract_data.xlsx and create each company object with the five parameters in the five columns:
  company_name, company_number, requires_ESA, requires_SEA, contact_email_address

  - Input from contracts folder - data structure: Same Company class
  iterate over the files in the new_contracts_2024 folder
  identify: 1) the company, 2) the type of contract (ESA, SEA), 3) the contract format (hard-copy, digital)
  update the company object based on the company number.

  Time complexity:
  O(n) to iterate over companies in excel list
  O(1) to update all data when object is created

  O(n) to iterate over pdfs in the folder
  O(1) to find the company in the dictionary and update each boolean for received copies

  - Output - format?
  Missing hard copy (not mailed, lost in mail, no intention of providing hard copy) send follow-up email
  Missing digital and hard copy (not yet actioned, awaiting signature, wrong or outdated contact) send follow-up email
